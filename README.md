### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is the source code home for Ryan Day.

- ðŸ”­ My work here is focused on Python, Data Science and APIs.
- :football: I generally tie my side projects to fantasy sports or sports analytics somehow, because who likes boring data? :soccer: 

- ðŸ“š I have a newsletter where I share tips on using APIs with AI and Data Science: [Signup for my Tip Sheet](https:tips.handsonapibook.com) ðŸ“•
