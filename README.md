### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is the source code home for Ryan Day.

- ðŸ”­ My work here is focused on Python, Data Science and APIs.
- :football: I generally tie my projects to fantasy sports or sports analytics somehow, because who likes boring data? :soccer: 

- ðŸ“š I am currently writing a book with O'Reilly: [Hands-On APIs for AI and Data Science](https://hands-on-api-book.com/) ðŸ“•
